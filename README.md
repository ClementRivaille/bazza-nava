# Bazza Nava

Bazza Nava is a musical game made with Godot. It uses samplers and music theory to create random melodies over a song. You can play it [on itch.io](https://itooh.itch.io/bazza-nava).

## 3D models

Because of their size, the 3D models (.dae files) cannot be uploaded to github. In order to run the game locally, you have to download them separately (they are available on the game page), and put them in their respective folders in `assets/models`. The _.dae.import_ can indicates you where to put them!

Of course, if you want to use them in your own project, don't forget to credit the authors below. They are all under Creative Commons licences.
